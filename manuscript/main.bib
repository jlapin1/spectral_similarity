	Abstract = {Isomeric molecules are important analytes in many biological and chemical arenas, yet their similarity poses challenges for many analytical methods, including mass spectrometry (MS). Tandem-MS provides significantly more information about isomers than intact mass analysis, but highly similar fragmentation patterns are common and include cases where no unique &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; peaks are generated between isomeric pairs. However, even in such situations, differences in peak intensity can exist and potentially contain additional information. Herein, we present a framework for comparing mass spectra that differ only in terms of peak intensity and include calculation of a statistical probability that the spectra derive from different analytes. This framework allows for confident identification of peptide isomers by collision-induced dissociation, higher-energy collisional dissociation, electron-transfer dissociation, and radical-directed dissociation. The method successfully identified many types of isomers including various d/l amino acid substitutions, Leu/Ile, and Asp/IsoAsp. The method can accommodate a wide range of changes in instrumental settings including source voltages, isolation widths, and resolution without influencing the analysis. It is shown that quantification of the composition of isomeric mixtures can be enabled with calibration curves, which were found to be highly linear and reproducible. The analysis can be implemented with data collected by either direct infusion or liquid-chromatography MS. Although this framework is presented in the context of isomer characterization, it should also prove useful in many other contexts where similar mass spectra are generated.},

	Abstract = {Antibody sequences can be determined at 99% accuracy directly from the polypeptide product by using bottom-up proteomics techniques. Sequencing accuracy at the peptide level is limited by the isobaric residues leucine and isoleucine, incomplete fragmentation spectra in which the order of two or more residues remains ambiguous due to lacking fragment ions for the intermediate positions, and isobaric combinations of amino acids, of potentially different lengths, for example, GG = N and GA = Q. Here, we present several updates to Stitch (v1.5), which performs template-based assembly of &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; peptides to reconstruct antibody sequences. This version introduces a mass-based alignment algorithm that explicitly accounts for mass coincidence errors. In addition, it incorporates a postprocessing procedure to assign I/L residues based on secondary fragments (satellite ions, &lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;w-&lt;/i&gt;ions). Moreover, evidence for sequence assignments can now be directly evaluated with the addition of an integrated spectrum viewer. Lastly, input data from a wider selection of &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; peptide sequencing algorithms are allowed, now including Casanovo, PEAKS, Novor.Cloud, pNovo, and MaxNovo, in addition to flat text and FASTA. Combined, these changes make Stitch compatible with a larger range of data processing pipelines and improve its tolerance to peptide-level sequencing errors.},
